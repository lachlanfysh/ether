Left button for
Pagination of current pattern - user can scroll through 4 pages of pattern spaces for the current pattern and place steps. Patterns are default 16 steps long but as long as there are pages with steps, so if the user adds steps to page 2 it becomes 32 steps long, page 3 it’s 48, page 4 it’s 64… if I user were to add things to page 4 but nothing on pages 2 and 3, it’s still 64 long with rests for all of page 2 and 3.

PHASE 1 - ENGINE COMPLETION (Priority):
Review existing engines in src/synthesis/engines/ and implement remaining 7 engines:
1) MacroChord, 2) MacroHarmonics, 3) FormantVocal, 4) NoiseParticles, 5) TidesOsc, 6) RingsVoice, 7) ElementsVoice, 8) DrumKit

PHASE 2 - GUI REVAMP (After engines complete):
Complete SwiftUI GUI implementation using resources in GUI/:
- Timeline View (8-track engine assignment)
- Engine Assignment Overlay (all 11 engines) 
- Sound Overlay (hero macros HARMONICS/TIMBRE/MORPH)
- Pattern Overlays (pitched + drum)
- Mod Page (LFOs + modulation matrix)
- Mix Page (channel strips + bus FX)
- MVVM architecture + touch optimization
- SVG icons + ColorBrewer palette integration

Follow LLM_EXTENDED_TASK_QUEUE.md for complete requirements. Use Mutable source in mutable_extracted/. Maintain real-time safety and professional quality."

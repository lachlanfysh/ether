Define the final core 16-parameter layout shared across engines:
- Core synth: HARMONICS, TIMBRE, MORPH
- Envelope: ATTACK, DECAY, SUSTAIN, RELEASE
- Tone/Mix: FILTER_CUTOFF, FILTER_RESONANCE, HPF, VOLUME, PAN, AMPLITUDE, CLIP
- Performance: ACCENT_AMOUNT, GLIDE_TIME

Include ranges and scales (log/exp/lin) and the fallback post-chain mapping so every parameter audibly does something even if an engine lacks native support (HPF tilt, LPF cutoff/Q, pre-gain, soft-clip, pan). Keep concise and implementable.

## Development Notes

### Current Priority
Starting with Timeline & Pattern Management as requested by user.

### Integration Strategy
- Connect UI to C++ engine as we go (not at the end)
- May require C++ engine modifications and builds along the way
- Add C++ integration tasks as needed

### Key Requirements
- 960√ó320 resolution (exact hardware specs)
- Engine-centric 8-track system
- Professional audio synthesizer interface
- Real-time performance requirements
- SmartKnob and hardware integration ready
